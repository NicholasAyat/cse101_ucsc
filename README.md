# CSE 101: Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my programming assignments for CSE 101: Data Structures & Algorithms at UC Santa Cruz.

## Course Description

CSE 101 covers fundamental data structures and algorithms including:
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees and Balanced Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Algorithm Analysis and Big-O Notation

## Class Structure

### Homework Assignments

#### Homework 0: Graphics Pattern Generator
- Implements recursive graphics patterns using Cairo Graphics Library
- Features two programs: basic recursive squares and bonus colored pattern
- Uses Cairo for graphics rendering

#### Homework 1: List and Stack ADT Implementation
- Implements generic List and Stack ADTs using void pointers

- Implements BFS and Dijkstra's algorithms
- Features shortest path finding in city networks
- Includes bonus task for all-pairs shortest paths

## Building and Running

Each project contains its own Makefile and README with specific instructions. Generally:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
make
./<executable-name>
```
